# AirFight_Game

This is a simple game, in theory, this is a game that can go on endlessly.<br />
Missing functionalities: I'm missing a new type of reward to provide temporary double fire power. <br />
New functionalities: the heart reward that heal the player. <br />
 <br />
Just play the "Hell" mode, the "Free" mode is super easy, basically built for 3-5 years old kids. <br />
only enemy jet will increase your score, the rock won't, if you left one enemy jet pass you, you will lose 1 life PLUS 100 in score, <br />
so if you think you can't shoot that jet, just use your body to destroy it :)<br />
My highest record is 820<br />
