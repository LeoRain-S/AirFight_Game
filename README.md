# AirFight_Game

This is a simple game, in theory, this is a game that can go on endlessly (if you are good at it).<br />
- You increase your score by killing enemy jet, destroy rocks won't increase the score.  <br />
- if you left one enemy jet pass you, you will lose 100 in score. <br />
- Don't get hit by rocks or enemy jet, it will hurt you (1 life). <br />
- The red heart will heal you. <br />
